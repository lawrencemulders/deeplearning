# deeplearning
A collection of deep learning projects. 

For the first completed project see Forest_Cover_Classification. After establishing a classification algorithmic function, an accuracy of 91.3% was achieved without the threat of overfitting nor underfitting. The data set stems from Kaggle. The final results of the algorithm is the following accuracy graph:
